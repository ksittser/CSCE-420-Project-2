# CSCE-420-Project-2
A couple of different programs, including a Fox and Hounds game, demonstrating minimax trees and alpha-beta pruning

Program #1 makes a minimax tree out of an input tree and finds the root value

Run with `g++ -std=c++11 hw2pr1.cpp` then `./a.out` and input a tree such as `((3,12,8),(2,4,6),(14,5,2))`

Program #2 is just like Program #1 but performs alpha-beta pruning before the minimax

Program #3 simulates a slight variation on the Fox and Hounds game, where the fox is Tom Brady and the hounds are LA Rams.  The player plays four Rams and attempts to block Brady's path down the game map.

Created Spring 2019 for Artificial Intelligence class.
